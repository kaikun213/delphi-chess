# Chess game in Delphi

An old project that our highschool informatics course developed in 2012/13. Credits to the whole team and our teacher. It is a chess game written in [delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)).


We showcased the game during the schools open-days by making heuristic-based adversories that people could play against. Further, we hosted a tournament between all the different heuristics. Our heuristic in this repository was based on fetching good moves from tournament DBs based on the game state and simple chess-tactics. It successfully won the competition.
